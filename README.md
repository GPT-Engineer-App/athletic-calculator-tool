The tool provides tailored workout suggestions, including plyometrics and speed work for explosive power, strength-building protocols for maximal strength, and conditioning programs for endurance. It uses precise data analysis to offer advice suited to the athlete's needs, employing technical language ideal for coaches and athletes. The tool ensures advice is actionable and based on sports science principles, ready to address any ambiguities in input data or goals.
